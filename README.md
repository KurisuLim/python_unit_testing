# Python Unit Test
* In this project I am using basic unit testing for
* Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
* In this version we are using assertEqual, what it does is
* it check if the first and second are equal. If the values
* does not compare equal, the test will fail.

# Resources
* Here is the link to the documentation I used in making this test.
